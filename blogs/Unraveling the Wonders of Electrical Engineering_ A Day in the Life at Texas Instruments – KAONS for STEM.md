# Unraveling the Wonders of Electrical Engineering: A Day in the Life at Texas Instruments

Have you ever thought about what goes into creating the tiny circuits
 that make your favorite gadgets work? Meet Najeeb Ayoka, a dedicated 
23-year-old electrical engineer at Texas Instruments. Every day, he 
immerses himself in the remarkable field of electric engineering, and 
thanks to his generosity –we were able to learn more about his career by
 asking him a few questions:

How did you start? (What inspired you, what did you need to study, etc.)

Najeeb’s journey into electrical engineering 
began in high school. He vividly recalls his science fair project, where
 he built a simple radio transmitter. “I was amazed by how you could 
send sound waves through the air with just a few components,” he beams. 
This early project ignited his passion for circuits and technology.

To pursue his dream, Najeeb needed a strong 
foundation in math and science. He attended the University of Florida, a
 leading engineering institution, and majored in electrical engineering.
 “The critical thinking skills I developed through math and physics were
 key,” Najeeb notes. He took specialized classes in circuit design and 
microelectronics, which were instrumental in honing his skills.

What do you enjoy about your career?

One of the most rewarding aspects of Najeeb’s 
job is the thrill of innovation. “Every day brings a new challenge,” he 
expresses with enthusiasm. “I work on cutting-edge technology that 
genuinely improves people’s lives.”

He enjoys collaborating with diverse teams of 
engineers and scientists. “We brainstorm, troubleshoot, and celebrate 
our achievements together,” he adds. Najeeb finds joy in watching his 
designs evolve, transforming from rough ideas into fully functional 
circuits.

Moreover, Najeeb values the positive impact his 
work has on the world. “Knowing my contributions support products in 
healthcare, automation, and environmental sustainability motivates me 
each day,” he explains.

Could you describe your typical work day?

Najeeb’s workday is filled with variety. His 
day starts early at 8 AM. After settling in, he reviews his goals for 
the day. “I often have team meetings to discuss current projects,” he 
says. Then, it’s time to get into circuit design.

Around 10 AM, Najeeb spends hours on software 
simulations to test his circuit designs. “It’s like playing a video game
 where you build your own levels,” he jokes. After lunch around noon, he
 enjoys discussions with his coworkers, covering topics from engineering
 hacks to the latest tech trends.

In the afternoon, he conducts hands-on testing 
of circuits for functionality, durability, and efficiency. “Trial and 
error is part of the process, and that’s completely normal,” Najeeb 
assures. He often measures metrics such as power consumption and signal 
integrity, ensuring his designs meet specific performance standards.

At the end of the day, usually around 5 PM, he 
documents his findings and prepares for tomorrow. “I love the feeling of
 accomplishment,” he remarks. “Every day brings new insights and 
learning opportunities.”

What advice would you give to anyone pursuing the same field as you?

Najeeb has valuable advice for aspiring 
engineers. “Stay curious! Explore different branches of engineering and 
ask questions,” he encourages. Hands-on experience is vital, too. “Join 
clubs or seek internships while in school. It truly makes a difference 
in your skill development and network.”

He believes in the power of teamwork. “Don’t 
isolate yourself; collaborate as much as you can,” he advises. Working 
together on ideas can lead to groundbreaking solutions.

Finally, Najeeb encourages students to keep 
pushing through challenges. “There will be tough days, but remember your
 passion. It will guide you through obstacles.”

Final Thoughts

Najeeb Ayoka’s journey as an electrical 
engineer at Texas Instruments is a blend of creativity, collaboration, 
and discovery. His passion for building circuits and innovative 
technology is inspiring, showcasing the excitement of working in STEM 
fields.
