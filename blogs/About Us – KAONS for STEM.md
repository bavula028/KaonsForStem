Hi there! We 
are FTC Team #7951, the Kaons, from Lafayette High School in Wildwood, 
MO. Our goals this year were to build a highly functional and efficient 
robot, as well as to spread awareness of STEM and FIRST (the 
organization with which we compete) to kids and peers in our community 
and around the world.

This blog, Kaons for STEM, is designed to share our findings with the
 STEM community. This includes the projects we accomplish, the hardware 
and software discoveries we make, and the professionals in the STEM 
community we have reached out to.

Through this blog, we hope to inspire individuals that are involved 
in STEM. We hope that no matter where you are, you stay curious and 
impassioned about STEM. Additionally, we hope that no matter what you 
do, you know that…

YES YOU ‘KAON.’
